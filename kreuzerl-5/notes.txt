Please implement data generators for property based testing for the TIC-TAK-TOE game.

These generators shall produce:

    fully filled correct boards
    fully filled erroneous boards (with wrong tokens e.g. 'A" instead of X, O, ...
    partially filled correct boards
    partially filled erroneous boards (e.g. 4 X's and only 2 O's)
    correct-winning boards

the functions in "correct and erroneous" should not be redundant.
